# Task List Management Guidelines

## Overview

This document provides instructions for working with the project task list located at `docs/tasks.md`. The task list contains 147 enumerated tasks organized across 4 development phases for the PDF Watermarking Application project.

## Task List Structure

The task list is organized into the following phases:
- **Phase 1**: Foundation and Core Infrastructure (Tasks 1-30)
- **Phase 2**: Web Interface and Basic Functionality (Tasks 31-65)
- **Phase 3**: Advanced Watermark Features (Tasks 66-100)
- **Phase 4**: Production Readiness and Quality Assurance (Tasks 101-133)
- **Enhancement Tasks**: Future Iterations (Tasks 134-147)

## Task Completion Workflow

### 1. Task Selection
- Work on tasks sequentially within each phase when possible
- Ensure prerequisite tasks are completed before starting dependent tasks
- Focus on completing entire subsections before moving to new areas
- Prioritize critical path tasks that block other development work

### 2. Task Execution
- Read the task description carefully and understand the requirements
- Break down complex tasks into smaller subtasks if needed
- Follow the technical specifications outlined in `docs/requirements.md` and `docs/plan.md`
- Test your implementation thoroughly before marking tasks complete

### 3. Task Completion
- Mark completed tasks by changing `[ ]` to `[x]`
- Add completion date in format `<!-- Completed: YYYY-MM-DD -->`
- Include brief notes about implementation details or deviations if applicable
- Example format:
  ```markdown
  - [x] 1. Initialize Scala project with proper SBT configuration <!-- Completed: 2024-01-15 -->
  ```

### 4. Documentation Updates
- Update relevant documentation when completing tasks
- Ensure code comments and README files reflect completed work
- Add new documentation files as specified in tasks
- Keep API documentation current with implemented features

## Quality Standards

### Code Quality Requirements
- Follow Scala functional programming best practices
- Use ZIO effect system consistently throughout the application
- Implement proper error handling using ZIO's typed error management
- Write comprehensive unit tests for all business logic
- Maintain test coverage above 85%

### Testing Requirements
- Write unit tests for each new component or function
- Add integration tests for API endpoints and file processing workflows
- Include property-based tests for complex algorithms
- Test error conditions and edge cases thoroughly
- Validate all user input and file operations

### Documentation Standards
- Document all public APIs and interfaces
- Include code examples in documentation where appropriate
- Write clear commit messages following conventional commit format
- Update README files with new features and configuration options
- Maintain changelog with completed features and bug fixes

## Task Dependencies

### Phase Dependencies
- Phase 2 tasks require completion of Phase 1 core infrastructure
- Phase 3 advanced features depend on Phase 2 web interface completion
- Phase 4 production readiness requires substantial completion of Phases 1-3
- Enhancement tasks can be worked on independently after core phases

### Critical Dependencies
- Tasks 12-16 (Core Architecture) must be completed before most other development
- Tasks 17-21 (PDF Processing Foundation) are prerequisites for all PDF-related features
- Tasks 31-35 (ZIO HTTP Server Setup) are required for all web functionality
- Tasks 22-26 (Testing Infrastructure) should be completed early for TDD approach

## Progress Tracking

### Weekly Reviews
- Review completed tasks and update progress weekly
- Identify blocked tasks and resolve dependencies
- Adjust timeline estimates based on actual completion rates
- Document any scope changes or new requirements

### Phase Completion Criteria
- **Phase 1**: All core infrastructure tasks completed, basic PDF processing functional
- **Phase 2**: Web interface operational, file upload and download working
- **Phase 3**: All watermark configuration options implemented and tested
- **Phase 4**: Application production-ready with comprehensive testing and documentation

### Reporting Format
Track progress using this format in weekly updates:
```
Phase 1: X/30 tasks completed (Y%)
Phase 2: X/35 tasks completed (Y%)
Phase 3: X/35 tasks completed (Y%)
Phase 4: X/33 tasks completed (Y%)
Enhancement: X/14 tasks completed (Y%)
Overall: X/147 tasks completed (Y%)
```

## Issue Resolution

### Blocked Tasks
- Document blocking issues with specific task numbers
- Identify root cause and required resolution steps
- Escalate to team leads if external dependencies are involved
- Consider alternative implementation approaches when blocked

### Scope Changes
- Document any changes to original task requirements
- Update task descriptions to reflect new scope
- Adjust dependent tasks accordingly
- Communicate scope changes to all team members

### Technical Debt
- Track technical debt items separately from main task list
- Schedule debt resolution during appropriate development phases
- Prioritize debt that impacts development velocity or code quality
- Document architectural decisions and trade-offs made

## Tools and Resources

### Development Tools
- Use IntelliJ IDEA or VS Code with Scala plugins
- Configure code formatting with Scalafmt
- Set up Scalafix for code analysis and refactoring
- Use SBT for build management and dependency resolution

### Documentation Tools
- Maintain task list in Markdown format for easy editing
- Use Git for version control of all documentation
- Generate API documentation from code comments
- Keep screenshots and diagrams for UI/UX tasks

### Testing Tools
- ScalaTest for unit and integration testing
- ZIO Test for ZIO-specific testing patterns
- ScalaCheck for property-based testing
- JMeter or similar for performance testing
- No mocks in tests

## Best Practices

### Task Management
- Update task list frequently to maintain accuracy
- Break large tasks into smaller, manageable subtasks
- Avoid marking tasks complete until fully tested
- Include code review as part of task completion criteria

### Collaboration
- Communicate task assignments clearly within team
- Avoid overlapping work on related tasks
- Share knowledge and implementation approaches
- Review and validate each other's completed tasks

### Continuous Improvement
- Regularly review and refine task breakdown accuracy
- Update estimation techniques based on completed work
- Identify process improvements for future projects
- Document lessons learned for knowledge sharing
