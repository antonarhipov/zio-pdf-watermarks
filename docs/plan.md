### Phase 3: Advanced Watermark Features (Weeks 7-9)

**Objectives**: Implement sophisticated watermark configuration options and preview capabilities.

**Key Deliverables**:
- Advanced positioning options (fixed coordinates, random placement)
- Orientation controls (fixed angles, random rotation)
- Font size configuration (fixed sizes, random ranges)
- Color customization (fixed colors, random per-letter coloring)
- Multiple watermark support with quantity controls
- Real-time preview functionality

**Technical Priorities**:
- Complex watermark rendering algorithms
- Coordinate validation and boundary checking
- Color management and contrast optimization
- Performance optimization for multiple watermarks
- Enhanced user experience with dynamic UI updates

### Phase 4: Production Readiness and Quality Assurance (Weeks 10-12)

**Objectives**: Ensure production-ready quality, performance, and reliability.

**Key Deliverables**:
- Comprehensive error handling and user feedback
- Performance optimization for large files and multiple watermarks
- Security hardening and input sanitization
- Comprehensive test suite (unit, integration, end-to-end)
- Documentation and deployment guides

**Technical Priorities**:
- Load testing and performance tuning
- Security audit and vulnerability assessment
- Comprehensive logging and monitoring
- Graceful degradation and fallback mechanisms
- Production deployment configuration

## Technical Architecture Enhancements

### Scalability Improvements

2. **Resource Management**: Proper memory management for handling large PDF documents
3. **Caching Strategy**: Cache processed configurations and intermediate results
4. **Connection Pooling**: Efficient database/file system connection management

### Security Enhancements

1. **Input Validation**: Comprehensive validation for all user inputs and file uploads
2. **File Security**: Secure temporary file handling and cleanup
3. **Rate Limiting**: Prevent abuse through request rate limiting
4. **CSRF Protection**: Cross-site request forgery protection for web interface
5. **Content Security Policy**: Implement CSP headers for XSS protection

### User Experience Improvements

1. **Progressive Web App**: Implement PWA features for better mobile experience
2. **Batch Processing**: Support for multiple file uploads and processing
3. **Template System**: Save and reuse watermark configurations
4. **Preview Enhancements**: Real-time preview with zoom and pan capabilities
5. **Accessibility**: WCAG compliance for inclusive user experience

### DevOps and Monitoring

1. **CI/CD Pipeline**: Automated testing, building, and deployment
2. **Containerization**: Docker support for consistent deployment environments
3. **Health Monitoring**: Application health checks and metrics collection
4. **Log Aggregation**: Centralized logging with structured log formats
5. **Performance Monitoring**: Real-time performance metrics and alerting

## Quality Assurance Strategy

### Testing Framework

1. **Unit Tests**: Comprehensive coverage of core business logic using ScalaTest
2. **Integration Tests**: End-to-end testing of API endpoints and file processing
3. **Property-Based Tests**: Use ScalaCheck for testing edge cases and invariants
4. **Performance Tests**: Load testing with JMeter or similar tools
5. **Security Tests**: Automated security scanning and penetration testing

### Code Quality

1. **Static Analysis**: Use Scalafix and Scalafmt for code consistency
2. **Code Reviews**: Mandatory peer reviews for all code changes
3. **Documentation**: Comprehensive API documentation and code comments
4. **Refactoring**: Continuous code improvement and technical debt management

## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks

1. **Memory Usage**: Large PDF files may cause memory issues
   - Mitigation: Streaming processing, memory profiling, garbage collection tuning
2. **PDFBox Compatibility**: Different PDF versions may have compatibility issues
   - Mitigation: Comprehensive testing with various PDF formats, fallback strategies
3. **Performance**: Complex watermark operations may impact response times
   - Mitigation: Asynchronous processing, caching, performance optimization

### Business Risks

1. **User Adoption**: Complex interface may deter users
   - Mitigation: User testing, progressive disclosure, helpful guidance
2. **Scalability**: Unexpected load may overwhelm the system
   - Mitigation: Load testing, auto-scaling, monitoring and alerting
