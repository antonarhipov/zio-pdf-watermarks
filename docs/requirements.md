# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for a PDF Watermarking Web Application. The application enables users to upload PDF files through a web interface and apply customizable watermarks to their documents. The system provides comprehensive configuration options for watermark appearance including positioning, orientation, font properties, and color settings. Users can control the number of watermarks applied to each document and preview results before downloading the processed files.

The application is built using modern Scala technologies including ZIO for functional programming, ZIO HTTP for web services, and Apache PDFBox for PDF manipulation, ensuring robust performance and maintainable code architecture.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: PDF File Upload
**User Story**: As a user, I want to upload PDF files through a web interface so that I can add watermarks to my documents conveniently.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- WHEN a user accesses the web application THEN the system SHALL display a file upload interface
- WHEN a user selects a PDF file for upload THEN the system SHALL validate that the file is a valid PDF format
- WHEN a user uploads an invalid file format THEN the system SHALL display an error message indicating "Only PDF files are supported"
- WHEN a user uploads a valid PDF file THEN the system SHALL confirm successful upload and proceed to watermark configuration
- WHEN a PDF file exceeds the maximum allowed size THEN the system SHALL display an appropriate error message
- WHEN the upload process fails THEN the system SHALL provide clear error feedback to the user

### Requirement 2: Watermark Position Configuration
**User Story**: As a user, I want to configure watermark positioning as either fixed or random so that I can control the placement of watermarks on my PDF pages.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- WHEN a user accesses watermark configuration THEN the system SHALL provide options for "Fixed Position" and "Random Position"
- WHEN a user selects "Fixed Position" THEN the system SHALL provide input fields for X and Y coordinates
- WHEN a user selects "Random Position" THEN the system SHALL automatically generate random coordinates for each watermark placement
- WHEN fixed coordinates are entered THEN the system SHALL validate that coordinates are within valid page boundaries
- WHEN invalid coordinates are provided THEN the system SHALL display validation errors with suggested valid ranges
- WHEN random positioning is selected THEN the system SHALL ensure watermarks do not overlap with critical document content areas

### Requirement 3: Watermark Orientation Configuration
**User Story**: As a user, I want to set watermark orientation as either fixed or random so that I can control the rotational appearance of watermarks.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- WHEN a user configures watermark settings THEN the system SHALL provide "Fixed Orientation" and "Random Orientation" options
- WHEN "Fixed Orientation" is selected THEN the system SHALL provide an input field for rotation angle in degrees
- WHEN "Random Orientation" is selected THEN the system SHALL generate random rotation angles between 0 and 360 degrees
- WHEN a fixed angle is specified THEN the system SHALL validate the input is a numeric value
- WHEN an invalid angle is entered THEN the system SHALL display an error message requesting a valid numeric angle
- WHEN orientation is applied THEN the system SHALL maintain watermark readability and avoid excessive rotation that makes text illegible

### Requirement 4: Watermark Font Size Configuration
**User Story**: As a user, I want to configure watermark font size as either fixed or random so that I can control the text size appearance in my watermarks.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- WHEN a user sets up watermarks THEN the system SHALL offer "Fixed Font Size" and "Random Font Size" options
- WHEN "Fixed Font Size" is selected THEN the system SHALL provide an input field for font size in points
- WHEN "Random Font Size" is selected THEN the system SHALL allow users to specify minimum and maximum font size ranges
- WHEN font size values are entered THEN the system SHALL validate they are positive numeric values
- WHEN invalid font sizes are provided THEN the system SHALL display error messages with acceptable range guidance
- WHEN random font sizes are used THEN the system SHALL ensure readability by maintaining minimum size thresholds
- WHEN font sizes are applied THEN the system SHALL scale watermarks appropriately to fit within page boundaries

### Requirement 5: Watermark Text Color Configuration
**User Story**: As a user, I want to set the color of each watermark letter as either fixed or random so that I can customize the visual appearance of my watermarks.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- WHEN a user configures watermark appearance THEN the system SHALL provide "Fixed Color" and "Random Color" options
- WHEN "Fixed Color" is selected THEN the system SHALL offer a color picker interface for RGB color selection
- WHEN "Random Color" is selected THEN the system SHALL generate random colors for each individual letter in the watermark text
- WHEN fixed colors are chosen THEN the system SHALL display a preview of the selected color
- WHEN random colors are applied THEN the system SHALL ensure sufficient contrast against document backgrounds for visibility
- WHEN color settings are saved THEN the system SHALL persist the configuration for the current session
- WHEN colors are applied THEN the system SHALL maintain consistent color application across all specified watermarks

### Requirement 6: Watermark Quantity Configuration
**User Story**: As a user, I want to define the number of watermarks to include in my final document so that I can control the watermark density and coverage.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- WHEN a user sets watermark parameters THEN the system SHALL provide an input field for specifying the number of watermarks
- WHEN the number of watermarks is specified THEN the system SHALL validate the input is a positive integer
- WHEN an invalid number is entered THEN the system SHALL display an error message requesting a valid positive number
- WHEN the watermark count exceeds reasonable limits THEN the system SHALL warn about potential performance impact
- WHEN multiple watermarks are configured THEN the system SHALL apply all specified configuration options to each watermark instance
- WHEN watermark quantity is set THEN the system SHALL distribute watermarks appropriately across document pages
- WHEN processing multiple watermarks THEN the system SHALL ensure proper spacing to avoid excessive overlap

### Requirement 7: Watermark Text Input
**User Story**: As a user, I want to specify the text content for my watermarks so that I can add meaningful labels or identifiers to my documents.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- WHEN a user configures watermarks THEN the system SHALL provide a text input field for watermark content
- WHEN watermark text is entered THEN the system SHALL validate the text is not empty
- WHEN no text is provided THEN the system SHALL display an error message requiring text input
- WHEN text contains special characters THEN the system SHALL handle them appropriately in the PDF output
- WHEN long text is entered THEN the system SHALL provide warnings about potential display issues
- WHEN text is configured THEN the system SHALL show a preview of how it will appear in the watermark

### Requirement 8: PDF Processing and Watermark Application
**User Story**: As a user, I want the system to process my PDF and apply watermarks according to my specifications so that I can receive a watermarked document.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- WHEN a user submits watermark configuration THEN the system SHALL process the uploaded PDF using Apache PDFBox
- WHEN processing begins THEN the system SHALL display a progress indicator to the user
- WHEN watermarks are applied THEN the system SHALL maintain the original PDF quality and formatting
